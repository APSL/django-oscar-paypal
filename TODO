Express checkout
----------------

Customer bypasses shipping address and goes straight to Express checkout from 
the basket page.

Supports pre-auth model

Gotchas:
- don't know who customer is until they return from paypal express - voucher may
  not be valid at that point (eg used, expired)
- can't validate country of shipping address until you hear back from PayPal
-

Getting set-up:
- Need a merchant account
